    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nFamily tradition says that Andrew moved from Whitley County, Kentucky to <br />\nthe Big Greenbrier Cove section of Sevier County, Tennessee (now in the <br />\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park, on the East Prong of the Pigeon <br />\nRiver) around 1869 with his first wife Charlotte and their children.  <br />\nHowever, they appeared in the 1870 Sevier County census in Gatlinburg or <br />\nits environs.  Perhaps they later moved to Big Greenbrier.  Sometime <br />\nbetween 1870 and 1871, Charlotte must have died, because Andrew remarried <br />\non July 20, 1872 and had a child by his second wife Mary Ann (Whaley) in <br />\n1873.  Mary Ann was the daughter of Perry Whaley who in 1870 was living <br />\nin Big Greenbrier.  According to oral history passed down by the Whaley <br />\nside of the family, Andrew and Mary Ann died close together around 1896 <br />\n\"when Andrew, Jr. was 4\" and \"they died of TB\" which was common in those <br />\ndays.  The children of Andrew and Mary Ann were taken in as orphans by <br />\nother families in Sevier County.  The older boys by the first wife went <br />\nback to Kentucky, except Simeon, who remained in Sevier County.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew served on the Union side in the Civil War, #973577 Co. E 32nd Ky <br />\nInfantry.  In 1890, Andrew applied for a war pension, but it was denied.  <br />\nOfficials claim that he deserted, but he said that he completed his <br />\nenlistment.  In 1891, he appealed, but lost again.  His claim states that <br />\nhe was \"lame in back and hip.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt may be significant that Andrew moved from the Wolf Creek community in <br />\nKentucky to Sevier County, Tennessee by the summer of 1870, around the <br />\nsame time that his father Daniel moved from Wolf Creek to the Marsh Creek <br />\ncommunity (now in McCreary County, Kentucky) by August 1870 (Bethel <br />\nChurch records).  It may have had something to do with lingering Civil <br />\nWar tensions.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn April 3, 2003, I received the following from Vicki Davenport Haun of <br />\nSevier County (a distant cousin):  \"I have some information on Andrew <br />\nRussell Davenport that I don't think you have.  This was told to me by my <br />\ngrandfather Mack Daniel Davenport.  Andrew was \"Conscripted\" into the <br />\nUnion Army from his field where he was working.  While he was in the <br />\nCivil War, he was run over by a wagon and had some disability though what <br />\nit was is not clear (see above).  When he returned to his family, the <br />\nneighbors had burned down his house because he was fighting for \"the <br />\nwrong side.\"  He found Charlotte and the children living in the corn <br />\ncrib.  That is why he moved to Tennessee.  Charlotte never recovered her <br />\nhealth and died after the move.  That is when Andrew married my great <br />\ngrandmother, Mary Ann \"Polly\" Whaley.  They died in a influenza epidemic <br />\nin the area.  They were treated by Dr. Bruce Montgomery, whose wife was a <br />\nrelative of Polly.  Mack lived with an aunt for some time, then was taken <br />\nby Dr. Montgomery.  When he was 13, Mack went to work for Little River <br />\nLumber Company.  By the time he was 16, he was foreman over much older <br />\nmen.  He worked in Elkmont, Smokemont, Fish Camp, and later in Hazel <br />\nCreek, North Carolina.  One of Mack's cousins, Nell, is still alive in <br />\nMiddlesboro.  She sent me a wooden rolling pin that was hand made by <br />\nAndy, as well as pictures of John Davenport, Mack's brother who was <br />\nmurdered, and one of her father, Marion.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNeither Andrew, Charlotte, nor Mary Ann have marked graves in Sevier <br />\nCounty.  By the time of Andrew's death, the male children by his first <br />\nwife were grown and had gone back to Kentucky, except for Simeon.  If <br />\nAndrew and Mary Ann indeed had died of TB, then the local people would <br />\nhave hastened their burial, and with no kin around that can explain the <br />\nlack of a headstone.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo far as this writer knows, Andrew was the first permanent Davenport <br />\nresident of Sevier County, and is the ancestor via the second family of <br />\nall the Davenports at Seymour, Tennessee and many of those at South <br />\nKnoxville, Tennessee.  His son Simeon by his first wife is the ancestor <br />\nof the Davenports who lived around Sevierville and Pigeon Forge, <br />\nTennessee.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew was probably prompted to move from Whitley County, Kentucky <br />\nbecause of Civil War conflicts with his surrounding community.  He may <br />\nhave been prompted to move to the Big Greenbrier area of Sevier County, <br />\nTennessee because he may have had preceding relatives there.  A John <br />\nDavenport was one of the earliest settlers of that area, but I cannot tie <br />\nhim to Andrew.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew's father Daniel moved out of Whitley County into McCreary County <br />\nin August 1870, not long after Andrew left for Tennessee.  There may have <br />\nbeen some family estrangement from the community where they lived.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nHis full name was Clyde Macaulay Davenport.  His father, Samuel <br />\nDavenport, was an avid reader of English literature, and named Clyde <br />\nafter the English essayist Thomas Macaulay (1800-1859).  Clyde, as his <br />\nchildren attested, was never quite certain of how to spell his middle <br />\nname.  He used McCalley, McCaulley, MacCaulley, etc. at different times.  <br />\nBorn in 1904, he did not have a birth certificate to consult.  When he <br />\nwent to apply for Social Security in 1966, he had to have a birth <br />\ncertificate created by affidavit, and he spelled his name Clyde McCaulley <br />\nDavenport.  The true spelling is verified in an old family bible owned by <br />\nhis mother, then passed down to his sister Nell Davenport Headrick, then <br />\nto her daughter Naomi Headrick Haynes, who had it in 2000.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nWhen Clyde was born, his parents did not have a boy's name picked out and <br />\nagreed upon, so<br />\nthey told the doctor that they would decide on one and give it to him <br />\n(the doctor) the next time<br />\nthat they came into town.  They never did.  As a consequence, the birth <br />\ncertificate was filed with<br />\nno name.  They told Clyde that he was named after his father, and called <br />\nhim \"Junior.\"  However,<br />\nwhen Clyde started school, they had him to put his name as Clyde McCall <br />\nDavenport, Jr. (!)<br />\nThis was continued up until Clyde went to join the U. S. Air Force in <br />\n1959 and discovered that<br />\nhis birth certificate was blank in the name field.  Taking this <br />\nopportunity to dispense with \"Jr.\"<br />\nwhich was expected to be nothing but trouble in the military, Clyde <br />\namended the birth certificate<br />\nwith the name Clyde McCall Davenport.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nTHE LINK TO JACOB DAVENPORT, TYRRELL COUNTY, NC\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah Davenport (1774-1856) lived in Whitley County, KY during <br />\n1800-1856. The Kentucky census states that he was born in North Carolina, <br />\nand his Whitley County death record in 1856 lists his parents as Jacob <br />\nand Elizabeth Davenport. There is only one Jacob and Elizabeth in the <br />\nregion in the necessary time frame, and they are in Tyrrell County, NC.  <br />\nWe wish to document and prove this link.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe most substantial piece of evidence is that a Zachariah Davenport <br />\nmarried Precilla Sprouill on March 1, 1794 in Tyrrell County, NC, then <br />\ndid not appear in any subsequent census there.  He apparently left for <br />\nthe Kentucky frontier.  On October 10, 1799, Zechariah married Jane <br />\nDouglass in Washington County, VA, the nearest jumping-off place for the <br />\nKentucky frontier.  If these two are the same, then Precilla must have <br />\ndied.   Zechariah had six children in Kentucky with Jane: William, <br />\nDaniel, George, Jacob, Elizabeth, and Sarah, all commonly recurring names <br />\nin the Tyrrell County Davenports (two being those of Zechariah's parents).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mormon FamilySearch International Genealogical Record (IGI) Film <br />\nNumber 903571 claims that Jacob was born \"ABT 1737\" and his father was <br />\nRichard.   The same record claims that Zachariah was born June 6, 1774, <br />\nwith parents Jacob Davenport and Johannah Garrett.  The International <br />\nGenealogical Record (IGI) Film Number 1239544 page 632 ref 13253 claims <br />\nthat Jacob was born \"ABT 1754\" and married Elizabeth Duncan.  <br />\nFamilySearch Ancestral File record AFN 11BW-B20 claims that William <br />\nDavenport was born \"ABT 1799\" in Whitley Co., KY, with parents Zachariah <br />\nDavenport [AFN 11BW-B0K] and Precilla Spruill [AFN 11BW-B1R].  However, <br />\nWilliam was actually born on May 31, 1800 (from his headstone] in <br />\nKentucky [from the census], and Zechariah had already married Jane <br />\nDouglass by that time [from the Washington County, VA marriage records].\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1815 tax list for Washington Co., NC, a Zachariah Davinport is <br />\nassesed for 280 acres valued at $1,200, about twice the average worth for <br />\nthe area.  However, Zachariah never appeared in any census of the area.  <br />\nBecause Zechariah was a substantial landowner, yet did not appear in the <br />\n1820 North Carolina census, it is this author's belief that there is <br />\nprobably a Washington County, NC will of Jacob Davenport sometime between <br />\n1800 and 1815.  This lead is being investigated; however, the Washington <br />\nCounty, NC courthouse burned in the late 1880s, taking all the wills with <br />\nit.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Tyrrell County marriage records, together with the 1800-1860 <br />\ncensuses, provide some very likely names for Zechariah's brothers.  <br />\nConsider the following, recalling that Washington County split off from <br />\nTyrrell County in 1800:\n</p>\n<p>\nNAME             WIFE                  MARRIAGE      BONDSMAN           <br />\nWITNESS\n</p>\n<p>\nMiles Dav.

From other records of <br />\nthe time, Samuel Chesson was a county official who probably handled <br />\nmarriage records.  Samuel's father John Chesson died in 1767; John was <br />\nbrother-in-law to Joseph and Benjamin Spruill (will, 1766).   John <br />\nChesson and probably Samuel lived near the Spruills.  In Samuel's <br />\ngeneration, a previous Stephen Davenport married Elizabeth Alexander on <br />\nDecember 28, 1778.\n</p>\n<p>\n1800 CENSUS\n</p>\n<p>\nNAME                           COUNTY                       PAGE        <br />\nCOUNTS\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Dav.

There are at least two Jacob Davenports in the <br />\nright time frame:\n</p>\n<p>\nCourt action of 17 Sep 1765: division of John Davenport's estate among <br />\nchildren John, Ephrain, Maryann, Jacob, Anna, Joanna, Joshua, and <br />\nHezekiah Davenport.\n</p>\n<p>\nRichard Davenport's will, 22 Nov 1773: Names sons John (eldest) and <br />\nJacob.  States Jacob has son Benjamin, daughter Sarah.  Did not mention <br />\nZachariah because he would have been born in 1774.\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport married Joanna Garrett, 1 February 1768, Tyrrell Co., <br />\nN.C., NC Reg:3:108\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport married Elizabeth Duncan, 17 February 1779, Tyrrell Co., <br />\nN.C., NC Reg:3:110\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah's death record in Whitley County, KY names Jacob and Elizabeth <br />\nas his parents.  However, Kentucky census records claim that he was born <br />\nin 1774, before the latter Jacob and Elizabeth Davenport were married.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah may have had a child by Precilla Spruill whom he named Joanna, <br />\nafter several of his female relatives in Tyrrell County, North Carolina.  <br />\nIn the Wolf Creek Cemetery, where all but one of Zechariah's children by <br />\nJane Douglass are buried, there is a headstone with indistinct <br />\ninscriptions that read: Joanna Deavenport, born October 18, 189? (sic?), <br />\ndied August ?? 1843, \"49 yrs 299 days.\"   This would have made her born <br />\nin 1793 when Zechariah was 19.   Zechariah was the first Davenport in the <br />\nWhitley County, KY area, and Joanna's birth date is too early for any of <br />\nZechariah's sons to be her father.  Again, Joanna (Johanna, Johannah) is <br />\na commonly recurring name among the Davenports and several other families <br />\nin Tyrrell County.  Of course, it is possible that she is just a <br />\nZechariah relative from elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1850 census in North Carolina, the following names occur, living <br />\nin the same neighborhood:\n</p>\n<p>\nNAME                                               COUNTY                 <br />\nTOWNSHIP          PAGE\n</p>\n<p>\nNathan Davenport                        Washington                 Cool <br />\nSprings               084<br />\nWilliam M.

If so, she would have been around 90 years of age.   <br />\n\"Cool Springs\" in the 1850s time frame refers to a spot near the crossing <br />\nof Chapel Swamp Creek by Holly Neck Road, in Washington County, near <br />\nSkinnersville.  Later, \"Cool Springs\" referred to present-day Creswell, <br />\nwhich is near the \"head of the Scuppernong River\" mentioned in old <br />\nDavenport wills and other colonial records of the 1700s.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1860 census, the following names occur, living in the same <br />\nneighborhood: <br />\nNAME                                                COUNTY                <br />\nTOWNSHIP         PAGE\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth Davenport                    Washington                Mackey's <br />\nFerry          603<br />\nElizabeth Davenport                    Washington                Mackey's <br />\nFerry          611<br />\nElizabeth Davenport                    Washington                Mackey's <br />\nFerry          623<br />\nGeorge B.

West of the present-day bridge across to Edenton, there is a <br />\nsmall settlement on the Sound named Mackeys.  According to Betty Pledger <br />\nSpruill of the Washington County Genealogical Society, \"Mackey's Ferry\" <br />\nand \"Mackeys\" refer to the same small settlement.  The 1786 census shows <br />\nJacob Davenport living in an area \"at the head of the Scuppernong.\"  <br />\nJoseph Phelps, Sr's will, July 21, 1787, states that a Jacob Davenport <br />\nlived adjacent to the Phelps clan near Phelps Lake. This would be in east <br />\ncentral Washington County, near Creswell and the Tyrrell County line, <br />\nlargely surrounded by swampland, and the easiest way by land out of the <br />\narea would have been toward Mackeys.  The modern-day road follows this <br />\npath.  There is an old road that runs from near Colonial Beach on the <br />\nSound, in the east, to Mackeys in the west, that is named Davenport <br />\nRoad.  The Davenports always had much interaction with the Spruills, such <br />\nas marriages and land sales, and the earliest Spruill on the South Shore <br />\nwas Dr. Godfrey Spruill in 1695, who set up a plantation near present-day <br />\nColonial Beach.  A large population of Spruill descendants built up in <br />\nthat local area.  It is likely that the earliest Davenports lived just <br />\ninland, south of the Spruill enclave on the Bay.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the first edition of this family history, I reported that another <br />\nindividual had found a will for Jacob Davenport in Washington County, NC <br />\nand it named Zechariah as one of his sons.  In a visit to Washington <br />\nCounty on November 16-23, 1997, I was unable to verify this claim.  The <br />\nWashington County courthouse had burned in the late 1880s, taking all the <br />\nwills with it.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

However, it is not certain that this is the <br />\nsame Zechariah as in Kentucky, later\n</p>\n<p>\nMarried Jane Douglass on October 10, 1799 in Washington County, Virginia <br />\n(Washington County marriage records).  Washington County, in Southwest <br />\nVirginia, was a jumping-off place for the Appalachian frontier and the <br />\nnearest permanently-settled trading area for Southeast Kentucky.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Whitley County, Kentucky by 1800 (Oldest son William born June 31, <br />\n1800 in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky census).\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1815 tax list for Washington County, North Carolina, a Zachariah <br />\nDavinport is listed as having 280 acres valued at $1,200, or about twice <br />\nthe typical worth in the area.  However, Zachariah never appears in any <br />\ncensus in North Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah in the 1820 Kentucky census had one son age 10 or under, two <br />\nsons 10 to 16 years old, one son 16 to 20 years of age, one daughter 10 <br />\nor under, and one daughter 10 to 16.  Subsequent censuses indicate that <br />\nthis was the extent of his family by Jane Douglass.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere is no will or other document known to this author that explicitly <br />\ngives the names of Zechariah's children.  However, after 1820 the <br />\nfollowing children come of age and appear in the censuses in Zechariah's <br />\nneighborhood, plus their ages match those indicated in the 1820 census, <br />\nand Zechariah is living in a household in 1850 with four of these (see <br />\nbelow).  Moreover, early Kentucky marriage, birth, death records list <br />\nJacob Davenport, born February 15, 1807, parents Zachariah Davenport and <br />\nJane Douglas.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam Davenport, b. June 31, 1800, d. June 13, 1847, buried Wolf <br />\nCreek Cem.\n</p>\n<p>\nDaniel Davenport, b. 1805, d. July 4, 1886, buried Bethel Baptist <br />\nCem. in McCreary Co.     (adjacent to Whitley Co.) Daniel's oldest son <br />\nGeorge (1827-1894, named for an uncle, below)     was born in North <br />\nCarolina (Kentucky death records).\n</p>\n<p>\nGeorge Davenport, b. January 7, 1804, d. November 4, 1868, buried <br />\nWolf Creek Cem.\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport, b. March 13, 1807, d. August 24, 1880, buried Wolf<br />\nCreek Cem.\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth Davenport, b. June 12, 1809, d. September 1?, 1887, buried <br />\nWolf Creek Cem.\n</p>\n<p>\nSarah \"Sally\" Davenport, b. 1812, d. 1884, buried Wolf Creek Cem.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnd of Zechariah's children with Jane Douglass.  All of the children's <br />\nnames are commonly-recurring names in the Davenport families of Tyrrell <br />\nCounty, North Carolina in the late 1700s.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah appears in the 1840 Kentucky census as head of a household with <br />\na younger family:  one male age 10-15, one male age 15-20, one male age <br />\n60-70 (Zechariah), two females age 5-10, and one female age 40-50.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah as an old man appears in the 1850 census living in the home of <br />\nhis son Jacob Davenport.  In the Federal Census of Southeastern Kentucky, <br />\nthe following are listed in one household:\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport     40<br />\nGeorge         45<br />\nZachariah 77?<br />\nElizabeth      38<br />\nSally          36<br />\nSally          15<br />\nJohn      11<br />\nRebecca         9<br />\nPolly           6\n</p>\n<p>\nThese dates are all low by at least two years, compared with headstone <br />\ndates; the census may have been started in 1848.  The children are <br />\napparently Jacob's, but Elizabeth or Sally is not the mother, because <br />\nJacob remarries (see below) with them in the household (Sarah was <br />\nnicknamed \"Sally\").  Elizabeth and Sally must be Jacob's unmarried <br />\nsisters.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1860 Kentucky census, the following are listed in one household:\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport     52<br />\nAmy (Cox) 32<br />\nSarah E.         2<br />\nGeorge         57<br />\nElizabeth      50<br />\nSarah          48\n</p>\n<p>\nThese dates agree with headstone dates.  From this, Jacob remarried at a <br />\nlate date (he was 49, according to the Whitley County marriage records), <br />\nGeorge probably never married, and Elizabeth and Sarah almost certainly <br />\ndid not marry.  All of the children in the 1850 census were old enough to <br />\nhave left home by 1860 if the earlier census was, in fact, started in <br />\n1848.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah died October 15, 1856 in Whitley County, Kentucky, age 82 <br />\nyears, 4 months, 9 days  (stated in Kentucky death records, available for <br />\nthat period].\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah's burial place is not known.  It is probably Wolf Creek <br />\nCemetery, where all but one of his children are, but there is no marked <br />\nheadstone.   This author has examined a headstone survey for all of the <br />\ncemeteries in Whitley County, and Zechariah is not listed.\n</p>\n<p>\nWife Jane Douglass was born between 1760 and 1770 (Kentucky census), <br />\nplace unknown, probably Virginia.  Died July 6, 1833; buried in Wolf <br />\nCreek Cemetery in Whitley County, Kentucky (marked headstone).\n</p>\n<p>\nOdd fact:  Although Zechariah had significant land holdings and a family, <br />\nthe Minutes of the Whitley County Court for 1818-1821 show that he was <br />\narrested, tried, and convicted of \"vagrancy.\"  The penalty was that the <br />\nsheriff was to \"hire\" him for seven months.  This meant that he was to be <br />\nhired out as a laborer to others in the community.  This, along with the <br />\nfact that in the 1840 census he was living with a younger woman and her <br />\nchildren, indicates that Zechariah may have been estranged from his own <br />\nfamily.\n</p>\n<p>\nPROBABLE FACTS\n</p>\n<p>\nProbable first marriage to Precilla Sprouill on March 1, 1794 in Tyrrell <br />\nCounty, North Carolina (stated in the North Carolina marriage records for <br />\nTyrrell County). However, it is not certain that this is the same <br />\nZechariah as in Kentucky, later. There is no other Zechariah of the right <br />\nage in any old records of the time for the region VA-NC-KY known to the <br />\nauthor.  This Zechariah did not set up a household in North Carolina, <br />\nbecause he did not appear in subsequent censuses.  However, a Zachariah <br />\nDavenport owned land in Washington County, North Carolina in 1815 (tax <br />\nlists).  Precilla's burial place is unknown to this author.\n</p>\n<p>\nProbable child by Precilla:  Joanna Davenport, born October 18, 1793, <br />\ndied August 1843, buried in Wolf Creek Cemetery.   Headstone is <br />\nindistinct:  says Joanna Davenport, born October 18, 189? (sic), died <br />\nAugust ??, 1843, \"49 yrs 299 days\".  Joanna probably never married.  The <br />\nname Joanna probably comes from Zechariah's (probable) mother, Joanna <br />\nGarrett (see below).  These figures reconcile nicely if Joanna's birth <br />\nyear is 1793, when Zechariah was 19 years of age.  Johannah is a common <br />\nname in the Davenport and allied families going back into the 1600s in <br />\nTyrrell County.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Joanna Davenport was Zechariah's child, she did not live in his <br />\nhousehold.  Possibly, she was raised by one of his siblings or by <br />\nPrecilla Sprouill's family.  Remember that Zachariah may have continued <br />\nto own property in Tyrrell County, in absentia, which could be the means <br />\nof supporting the child Joanna.  In the Tyrrell County census of 1820, a <br />\nJoanna Davenport appears as head of household for the first time, with <br />\nage 26-46 (she would have been just over 26) and does not appear <br />\nthereafter.  If the hypothesis is correct, she moved to Kentucky to be <br />\nnear her father, and died there in 1843.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah's parents, as stated on his death record, were Jacob and <br />\nElizabeth Davenport.  A Jacob Davenport of about the right age married <br />\n(1) Joanna Garrett on February 1, 1768 in Tyrrell County (North Carolina <br />\nmarriage records).  If this is Zechariah's father, then his mother's name <br />\nwas Joanna.  Jacob married (2) Elizabeth Duncan on February 17, 1779 in <br />\nTyrrell County (North Carolina marriage records).  There is no proof that <br />\nthese two marriage records refer to the same Jacob Davenport, but the <br />\nfact that Zechariah named his (probable) first child Joanna, yet his <br />\ndeath record lists his parents as Jacob and Elizabeth Davenport, is very <br />\nsuggestive.  Zechariah would have been raised from age 5 by Elizabeth, <br />\nand probably could scarcely remember Joanna.  Perhaps Jacob's first wife <br />\ndied, which was not uncommon.  Moreover, Zechariah named two of his <br />\nchildren Jacob and Elizabeth.  Confounding this hypothesis is the fact <br />\nthat there were at least three Jacob Davenports in Tyrrell County in the <br />\nlate 1700s. In a court action of 17 Sep 1765, John Davenport was stated <br />\nto have a son Jacob.  In Richard Davenport's will of 22 Nov 1773, he was <br />\nstated to have a son Jacob.  One of these is \"our\" Jacob.  In the Tyrrell <br />\nCounty tax list of 1784, there was a Jacob Davenport, Sr. and a Jacob <br />\nDavenport, Jr. in separate households.   The two Jacob Davenport <br />\nmarriages could merely refer to any of the three Jacobs.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Zechariah is buried at Wolf Creek, one explanation for why he does not <br />\nhave a headstone is community division over the issues that would <br />\neventually erupt as the Civil War.  Some of Zechariah's sons and nephews <br />\nspent some time in Arkansas in the 1840s and 1850s, because they had <br />\nchildren that are listed as born in Arkansas.  Kentucky was bitterly <br />\ndivided, and moving to Arkansas-Missouri territory was one way to escape <br />\nthe conflict and be on the Union side. Moreover, it is known that many <br />\nheadstones in cemeteries all over the South were removed or defaced <br />\nbecause of their owner's political views.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mormon FamilySearch International Genealogical Record (IGI) Film <br />\nNumber 903571 claims that Jacob was born \"ABT 1737\" and his father was <br />\nRichard.   The same record claims that Zachariah was born June 6, 1774, <br />\nwith parents Jacob Davenport and Johannah Garrett.  FamilySearch <br />\nAncestral File record AFN 11BW-B20 claims that William Davenport was born <br />\n\"ABT 1799\" in Whitley Co., KY, with parents Zachariah Davenport [AFN <br />\n11BW-B0K] and Precilla Spruill [AFN 11BW-B1R].  However, William was <br />\nactually born on May 31, 1800 (from his headstone] in Kentucky [from the <br />\ncensus], and Zechariah had already married Jane Douglass by that time <br />\n[from the Washington County, VA marriage records].\n</p>\n<p>\nIn roughly the same time frame as the above Zachariah, there was a <br />\nZachariah Davenport in the Pendleton District in South Carolina, who <br />\nmoved to Missouri.  There is no overlap or confusion in their respective <br />\nrecords.  He is probably related to James, Francis, and Joseph Davenport <br />\nwho were Revolutionary War soldiers from South Carolina.  This Zachariah <br />\nmarried Eliza Wittenberg on March 17, 1831 in Cape Girardeau County, <br />\nMissouri, and also received a land grant there in 1845.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

This is the largest grant known to <br />\nthis author in Sevier County.   It is not clear to this author upon what <br />\nbasis the grants were made.  Perhaps it was because his father had <br />\nparticipated in the Revolutionary War.  The land was bounded by the East <br />\nProng of the Pigeon River, Webb's Creek, the Cocke/Sevier County line, <br />\nand a line well up on the slope of the Western escarpment of the Smoky <br />\nMountains.  Shortly after 1870, Alexander Preston moved to Grainger <br />\nCounty where the farm land was much better and where some of his <br />\noffspring lived.  From historical documents, he had difficulty in selling <br />\nall of his Sevier County land.  William Williams (1843-1921) bought 600 <br />\nacres from him at one dollar per acre.  The sales receipt, which my <br />\nmother, Mamie Williams Davenport (1911-), had in her possession in the <br />\n1970s was a simple statement of the acreage and selling price, <br />\nhandwritten on simple ruled notepad paper.  William's land lay along the <br />\nCocke/Sevier County line and extended from well up on the mountain to <br />\ndown almost to the Jones Cove Community.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nFamily tradition says that Andrew moved from Whitley County, Kentucky to <br />\nthe Big Greenbrier Cove section of Sevier County, Tennessee (now in the <br />\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park, on the East Prong of the Pigeon <br />\nRiver) around 1869 with his first wife Charlotte and their children.  <br />\nHowever, they appeared in the 1870 Sevier County census in Gatlinburg or <br />\nits environs.  Perhaps they later moved to Big Greenbrier.  Sometime <br />\nbetween 1870 and 1871, Charlotte must have died, because Andrew remarried <br />\non July 20, 1872 and had a child by his second wife Mary Ann (Whaley) in <br />\n1873.  Mary Ann was the daughter of Perry Whaley who in 1870 was living <br />\nin Big Greenbrier.  According to oral history passed down by the Whaley <br />\nside of the family, Andrew and Mary Ann died close together around 1896 <br />\n\"when Andrew, Jr. was 4\" and \"they died of TB\" which was common in those <br />\ndays.  The children of Andrew and Mary Ann were taken in as orphans by <br />\nother families in Sevier County.  The older boys by the first wife went <br />\nback to Kentucky, except Simeon, who remained in Sevier County.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew served on the Union side in the Civil War, #973577 Co. E 32nd Ky <br />\nInfantry.  In 1890, Andrew applied for a war pension, but it was denied.  <br />\nOfficials claim that he deserted, but he said that he completed his <br />\nenlistment.  In 1891, he appealed, but lost again.  His claim states that <br />\nhe was \"lame in back and hip.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt may be significant that Andrew moved from the Wolf Creek community in <br />\nKentucky to Sevier County, Tennessee by the summer of 1870, around the <br />\nsame time that his father Daniel moved from Wolf Creek to the Marsh Creek <br />\ncommunity (now in McCreary County, Kentucky) by August 1870 (Bethel <br />\nChurch records).  It may have had something to do with lingering Civil <br />\nWar tensions.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn April 3, 2003, I received the following from Vicki Davenport Haun of <br />\nSevier County (a distant cousin):  \"I have some information on Andrew <br />\nRussell Davenport that I don't think you have.  This was told to me by my <br />\ngrandfather Mack Daniel Davenport.  Andrew was \"Conscripted\" into the <br />\nUnion Army from his field where he was working.  While he was in the <br />\nCivil War, he was run over by a wagon and had some disability though what <br />\nit was is not clear (see above).  When he returned to his family, the <br />\nneighbors had burned down his house because he was fighting for \"the <br />\nwrong side.\"  He found Charlotte and the children living in the corn <br />\ncrib.  That is why he moved to Tennessee.  Charlotte never recovered her <br />\nhealth and died after the move.  That is when Andrew married my great <br />\ngrandmother, Mary Ann \"Polly\" Whaley.  They died in a influenza epidemic <br />\nin the area.  They were treated by Dr. Bruce Montgomery, whose wife was a <br />\nrelative of Polly.  Mack lived with an aunt for some time, then was taken <br />\nby Dr. Montgomery.  When he was 13, Mack went to work for Little River <br />\nLumber Company.  By the time he was 16, he was foreman over much older <br />\nmen.  He worked in Elkmont, Smokemont, Fish Camp, and later in Hazel <br />\nCreek, North Carolina.  One of Mack's cousins, Nell, is still alive in <br />\nMiddlesboro.  She sent me a wooden rolling pin that was hand made by <br />\nAndy, as well as pictures of John Davenport, Mack's brother who was <br />\nmurdered, and one of her father, Marion.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNeither Andrew, Charlotte, nor Mary Ann have marked graves in Sevier <br />\nCounty.  By the time of Andrew's death, the male children by his first <br />\nwife were grown and had gone back to Kentucky, except for Simeon.  If <br />\nAndrew and Mary Ann indeed had died of TB, then the local people would <br />\nhave hastened their burial, and with no kin around that can explain the <br />\nlack of a headstone.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo far as this writer knows, Andrew was the first permanent Davenport <br />\nresident of Sevier County, and is the ancestor via the second family of <br />\nall the Davenports at Seymour, Tennessee and many of those at South <br />\nKnoxville, Tennessee.  His son Simeon by his first wife is the ancestor <br />\nof the Davenports who lived around Sevierville and Pigeon Forge, <br />\nTennessee.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew was probably prompted to move from Whitley County, Kentucky <br />\nbecause of Civil War conflicts with his surrounding community.  He may <br />\nhave been prompted to move to the Big Greenbrier area of Sevier County, <br />\nTennessee because he may have had preceding relatives there.  A John <br />\nDavenport was one of the earliest settlers of that area, but I cannot tie <br />\nhim to Andrew.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew's father Daniel moved out of Whitley County into McCreary County <br />\nin August 1870, not long after Andrew left for Tennessee.  There may have <br />\nbeen some family estrangement from the community where they lived.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nHis full name was Clyde Macaulay Davenport.  His father, Samuel <br />\nDavenport, was an avid reader of English literature, and named Clyde <br />\nafter the English essayist Thomas Macaulay (1800-1859).  Clyde, as his <br />\nchildren attested, was never quite certain of how to spell his middle <br />\nname.  He used McCalley, McCaulley, MacCaulley, etc. at different times.  <br />\nBorn in 1904, he did not have a birth certificate to consult.  When he <br />\nwent to apply for Social Security in 1966, he had to have a birth <br />\ncertificate created by affidavit, and he spelled his name Clyde McCaulley <br />\nDavenport.  The true spelling is verified in an old family bible owned by <br />\nhis mother, then passed down to his sister Nell Davenport Headrick, then <br />\nto her daughter Naomi Headrick Haynes, who had it in 2000.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nWhen Clyde was born, his parents did not have a boy's name picked out and <br />\nagreed upon, so<br />\nthey told the doctor that they would decide on one and give it to him <br />\n(the doctor) the next time<br />\nthat they came into town.  They never did.  As a consequence, the birth <br />\ncertificate was filed with<br />\nno name.  They told Clyde that he was named after his father, and called <br />\nhim \"Junior.\"  However,<br />\nwhen Clyde started school, they had him to put his name as Clyde McCall <br />\nDavenport, Jr. (!)<br />\nThis was continued up until Clyde went to join the U. S. Air Force in <br />\n1959 and discovered that<br />\nhis birth certificate was blank in the name field.  Taking this <br />\nopportunity to dispense with \"Jr.\"<br />\nwhich was expected to be nothing but trouble in the military, Clyde <br />\namended the birth certificate<br />\nwith the name Clyde McCall Davenport.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nDaniel and Mary Davenport were released by letter from Wolf Creek Baptist <br />\nChurch in August 1870.  They moved to near Pine Knot, McCreary County, <br />\nKentucky and formed the Bethel Baptist Church, which is still there in <br />\n1999.  Their daughter Elizabeth and her husband Jobe Perkins, were <br />\nalready living there when Daniel moved.  The church was formed in the <br />\nhome of Jobe Perkins.  Daniel's daughters Jane and Sarah, along with <br />\nSarah's husband Calvin Patrick, came by letter in 1887 from the Pleasant <br />\nHill Baptist Church.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt may be significant that Daniel Davenport and his son Andrew Davenport <br />\nmoved their families out of the Wolf Creek Community at about the same <br />\ntime in 1870.  There may have been some bad blood between them and the <br />\ncommunity, possibly involving ill feelings dating back to the Civil War.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPerson Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nTHE LINK TO JACOB DAVENPORT, TYRRELL COUNTY, NC\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah Davenport (1774-1856) lived in Whitley County, KY during <br />\n1800-1856. The Kentucky census states that he was born in North Carolina, <br />\nand his Whitley County death record in 1856 lists his parents as Jacob <br />\nand Elizabeth Davenport. There is only one Jacob and Elizabeth in the <br />\nregion in the necessary time frame, and they are in Tyrrell County, NC.  <br />\nWe wish to document and prove this link.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe most substantial piece of evidence is that a Zachariah Davenport <br />\nmarried Precilla Sprouill on March 1, 1794 in Tyrrell County, NC, then <br />\ndid not appear in any subsequent census there.  He apparently left for <br />\nthe Kentucky frontier.  On October 10, 1799, Zechariah married Jane <br />\nDouglass in Washington County, VA, the nearest jumping-off place for the <br />\nKentucky frontier.  If these two are the same, then Precilla must have <br />\ndied.   Zechariah had six children in Kentucky with Jane: William, <br />\nDaniel, George, Jacob, Elizabeth, and Sarah, all commonly recurring names <br />\nin the Tyrrell County Davenports (two being those of Zechariah's parents).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mormon FamilySearch International Genealogical Record (IGI) Film <br />\nNumber 903571 claims that Jacob was born \"ABT 1737\" and his father was <br />\nRichard.   The same record claims that Zachariah was born June 6, 1774, <br />\nwith parents Jacob Davenport and Johannah Garrett.  The International <br />\nGenealogical Record (IGI) Film Number 1239544 page 632 ref 13253 claims <br />\nthat Jacob was born \"ABT 1754\" and married Elizabeth Duncan.  <br />\nFamilySearch Ancestral File record AFN 11BW-B20 claims that William <br />\nDavenport was born \"ABT 1799\" in Whitley Co., KY, with parents Zachariah <br />\nDavenport [AFN 11BW-B0K] and Precilla Spruill [AFN 11BW-B1R].  However, <br />\nWilliam was actually born on May 31, 1800 (from his headstone] in <br />\nKentucky [from the census], and Zechariah had already married Jane <br />\nDouglass by that time [from the Washington County, VA marriage records].\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1815 tax list for Washington Co., NC, a Zachariah Davinport is <br />\nassesed for 280 acres valued at $1,200, about twice the average worth for <br />\nthe area.  However, Zachariah never appeared in any census of the area.  <br />\nBecause Zechariah was a substantial landowner, yet did not appear in the <br />\n1820 North Carolina census, it is this author's belief that there is <br />\nprobably a Washington County, NC will of Jacob Davenport sometime between <br />\n1800 and 1815.  This lead is being investigated; however, the Washington <br />\nCounty, NC courthouse burned in the late 1880s, taking all the wills with <br />\nit.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Tyrrell County marriage records, together with the 1800-1860 <br />\ncensuses, provide some very likely names for Zechariah's brothers.  <br />\nConsider the following, recalling that Washington County split off from <br />\nTyrrell County in 1800:\n</p>\n<p>\nNAME             WIFE                  MARRIAGE      BONDSMAN           <br />\nWITNESS\n</p>\n<p>\nMiles Dav.

Norman\n</p>\n<p>\nJesse Davenport died before 1815, according to the 1815 Washington County <br />\ntax list.\n</p>\n<p>\nSamuel Chesson was of a previous generation, because he married in 1778 <br />\n(died before 1815, according to 1815 tax list).  From other records of <br />\nthe time, Samuel Chesson was a county official who probably handled <br />\nmarriage records.  Samuel's father John Chesson died in 1767; John was <br />\nbrother-in-law to Joseph and Benjamin Spruill (will, 1766).   John <br />\nChesson and probably Samuel lived near the Spruills.  In Samuel's <br />\ngeneration, a previous Stephen Davenport married Elizabeth Alexander on <br />\nDecember 28, 1778.\n</p>\n<p>\n1800 CENSUS\n</p>\n<p>\nNAME                           COUNTY                       PAGE        <br />\nCOUNTS\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Dav.

There are at least two Jacob Davenports in the <br />\nright time frame:\n</p>\n<p>\nCourt action of 17 Sep 1765: division of John Davenport's estate among <br />\nchildren John, Ephrain, Maryann, Jacob, Anna, Joanna, Joshua, and <br />\nHezekiah Davenport.\n</p>\n<p>\nRichard Davenport's will, 22 Nov 1773: Names sons John (eldest) and <br />\nJacob.  States Jacob has son Benjamin, daughter Sarah.  Did not mention <br />\nZachariah because he would have been born in 1774.\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport married Joanna Garrett, 1 February 1768, Tyrrell Co., <br />\nN.C., NC Reg:3:108\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport married Elizabeth Duncan, 17 February 1779, Tyrrell Co., <br />\nN.C., NC Reg:3:110\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah's death record in Whitley County, KY names Jacob and Elizabeth <br />\nas his parents.  However, Kentucky census records claim that he was born <br />\nin 1774, before the latter Jacob and Elizabeth Davenport were married.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah may have had a child by Precilla Spruill whom he named Joanna, <br />\nafter several of his female relatives in Tyrrell County, North Carolina.  <br />\nIn the Wolf Creek Cemetery, where all but one of Zechariah's children by <br />\nJane Douglass are buried, there is a headstone with indistinct <br />\ninscriptions that read: Joanna Deavenport, born October 18, 189? (sic?), <br />\ndied August ?? 1843, \"49 yrs 299 days.\"   This would have made her born <br />\nin 1793 when Zechariah was 19.   Zechariah was the first Davenport in the <br />\nWhitley County, KY area, and Joanna's birth date is too early for any of <br />\nZechariah's sons to be her father.  Again, Joanna (Johanna, Johannah) is <br />\na commonly recurring name among the Davenports and several other families <br />\nin Tyrrell County.  Of course, it is possible that she is just a <br />\nZechariah relative from elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1850 census in North Carolina, the following names occur, living <br />\nin the same neighborhood:\n</p>\n<p>\nNAME                                               COUNTY                 <br />\nTOWNSHIP          PAGE\n</p>\n<p>\nNathan Davenport                        Washington                 Cool <br />\nSprings               084<br />\nWilliam M.

If so, she would have been around 90 years of age.   <br />\n\"Cool Springs\" in the 1850s time frame refers to a spot near the crossing <br />\nof Chapel Swamp Creek by Holly Neck Road, in Washington County, near <br />\nSkinnersville.  Later, \"Cool Springs\" referred to present-day Creswell, <br />\nwhich is near the \"head of the Scuppernong River\" mentioned in old <br />\nDavenport wills and other colonial records of the 1700s.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1860 census, the following names occur, living in the same <br />\nneighborhood: <br />\nNAME                                                COUNTY                <br />\nTOWNSHIP         PAGE\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth Davenport                    Washington                Mackey's <br />\nFerry          603<br />\nElizabeth Davenport                    Washington                Mackey's <br />\nFerry          611<br />\nElizabeth Davenport                    Washington                Mackey's <br />\nFerry          623<br />\nGeorge B.

West of the present-day bridge across to Edenton, there is a <br />\nsmall settlement on the Sound named Mackeys.  According to Betty Pledger <br />\nSpruill of the Washington County Genealogical Society, \"Mackey's Ferry\" <br />\nand \"Mackeys\" refer to the same small settlement.  The 1786 census shows <br />\nJacob Davenport living in an area \"at the head of the Scuppernong.\"  <br />\nJoseph Phelps, Sr's will, July 21, 1787, states that a Jacob Davenport <br />\nlived adjacent to the Phelps clan near Phelps Lake. This would be in east <br />\ncentral Washington County, near Creswell and the Tyrrell County line, <br />\nlargely surrounded by swampland, and the easiest way by land out of the <br />\narea would have been toward Mackeys.  The modern-day road follows this <br />\npath.  There is an old road that runs from near Colonial Beach on the <br />\nSound, in the east, to Mackeys in the west, that is named Davenport <br />\nRoad.  The Davenports always had much interaction with the Spruills, such <br />\nas marriages and land sales, and the earliest Spruill on the South Shore <br />\nwas Dr. Godfrey Spruill in 1695, who set up a plantation near present-day <br />\nColonial Beach.  A large population of Spruill descendants built up in <br />\nthat local area.  It is likely that the earliest Davenports lived just <br />\ninland, south of the Spruill enclave on the Bay.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the first edition of this family history, I reported that another <br />\nindividual had found a will for Jacob Davenport in Washington County, NC <br />\nand it named Zechariah as one of his sons.  In a visit to Washington <br />\nCounty on November 16-23, 1997, I was unable to verify this claim.  The <br />\nWashington County courthouse had burned in the late 1880s, taking all the <br />\nwills with it.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

However, it is not certain that this is the <br />\nsame Zechariah as in Kentucky, later\n</p>\n<p>\nMarried Jane Douglass on October 10, 1799 in Washington County, Virginia <br />\n(Washington County marriage records).  Washington County, in Southwest <br />\nVirginia, was a jumping-off place for the Appalachian frontier and the <br />\nnearest permanently-settled trading area for Southeast Kentucky.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Whitley County, Kentucky by 1800 (Oldest son William born June 31, <br />\n1800 in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky census).\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1815 tax list for Washington County, North Carolina, a Zachariah <br />\nDavinport is listed as having 280 acres valued at $1,200, or about twice <br />\nthe typical worth in the area.  However, Zachariah never appears in any <br />\ncensus in North Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah in the 1820 Kentucky census had one son age 10 or under, two <br />\nsons 10 to 16 years old, one son 16 to 20 years of age, one daughter 10 <br />\nor under, and one daughter 10 to 16.  Subsequent censuses indicate that <br />\nthis was the extent of his family by Jane Douglass.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere is no will or other document known to this author that explicitly <br />\ngives the names of Zechariah's children.  However, after 1820 the <br />\nfollowing children come of age and appear in the censuses in Zechariah's <br />\nneighborhood, plus their ages match those indicated in the 1820 census, <br />\nand Zechariah is living in a household in 1850 with four of these (see <br />\nbelow).  Moreover, early Kentucky marriage, birth, death records list <br />\nJacob Davenport, born February 15, 1807, parents Zachariah Davenport and <br />\nJane Douglas.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam Davenport, b.

All of the children's <br />\nnames are commonly-recurring names in the Davenport families of Tyrrell <br />\nCounty, North Carolina in the late 1700s.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah appears in the 1840 Kentucky census as head of a household with <br />\na younger family:  one male age 10-15, one male age 15-20, one male age <br />\n60-70 (Zechariah), two females age 5-10, and one female age 40-50.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah as an old man appears in the 1850 census living in the home of <br />\nhis son Jacob Davenport.  In the Federal Census of Southeastern Kentucky, <br />\nthe following are listed in one household:\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport     40<br />\nGeorge         45<br />\nZachariah 77?<br />\nElizabeth      38<br />\nSally          36<br />\nSally          15<br />\nJohn      11<br />\nRebecca         9<br />\nPolly           6\n</p>\n<p>\nThese dates are all low by at least two years, compared with headstone <br />\ndates; the census may have been started in 1848.  The children are <br />\napparently Jacob's, but Elizabeth or Sally is not the mother, because <br />\nJacob remarries (see below) with them in the household (Sarah was <br />\nnicknamed \"Sally\").  Elizabeth and Sally must be Jacob's unmarried <br />\nsisters.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the 1860 Kentucky census, the following are listed in one household:\n</p>\n<p>\nJacob Davenport     52<br />\nAmy (Cox) 32<br />\nSarah E.         2<br />\nGeorge         57<br />\nElizabeth      50<br />\nSarah          48\n</p>\n<p>\nThese dates agree with headstone dates.  From this, Jacob remarried at a <br />\nlate date (he was 49, according to the Whitley County marriage records), <br />\nGeorge probably never married, and Elizabeth and Sarah almost certainly <br />\ndid not marry.  All of the children in the 1850 census were old enough to <br />\nhave left home by 1860 if the earlier census was, in fact, started in <br />\n1848.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah died October 15, 1856 in Whitley County, Kentucky, age 82 <br />\nyears, 4 months, 9 days  (stated in Kentucky death records, available for <br />\nthat period].\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah's burial place is not known.  It is probably Wolf Creek <br />\nCemetery, where all but one of his children are, but there is no marked <br />\nheadstone.   This author has examined a headstone survey for all of the <br />\ncemeteries in Whitley County, and Zechariah is not listed.\n</p>\n<p>\nWife Jane Douglass was born between 1760 and 1770 (Kentucky census), <br />\nplace unknown, probably Virginia.  Died July 6, 1833; buried in Wolf <br />\nCreek Cemetery in Whitley County, Kentucky (marked headstone).\n</p>\n<p>\nOdd fact:  Although Zechariah had significant land holdings and a family, <br />\nthe Minutes of the Whitley County Court for 1818-1821 show that he was <br />\narrested, tried, and convicted of \"vagrancy.\"  The penalty was that the <br />\nsheriff was to \"hire\" him for seven months.  This meant that he was to be <br />\nhired out as a laborer to others in the community.  This, along with the <br />\nfact that in the 1840 census he was living with a younger woman and her <br />\nchildren, indicates that Zechariah may have been estranged from his own <br />\nfamily.\n</p>\n<p>\nPROBABLE FACTS\n</p>\n<p>\nProbable first marriage to Precilla Sprouill on March 1, 1794 in Tyrrell <br />\nCounty, North Carolina (stated in the North Carolina marriage records for <br />\nTyrrell County). However, it is not certain that this is the same <br />\nZechariah as in Kentucky, later. There is no other Zechariah of the right <br />\nage in any old records of the time for the region VA-NC-KY known to the <br />\nauthor.  This Zechariah did not set up a household in North Carolina, <br />\nbecause he did not appear in subsequent censuses.  However, a Zachariah <br />\nDavenport owned land in Washington County, North Carolina in 1815 (tax <br />\nlists).  Precilla's burial place is unknown to this author.\n</p>\n<p>\nProbable child by Precilla:  Joanna Davenport, born October 18, 1793, <br />\ndied August 1843, buried in Wolf Creek Cemetery.   Headstone is <br />\nindistinct:  says Joanna Davenport, born October 18, 189? (sic), died <br />\nAugust ??, 1843, \"49 yrs 299 days\".  Joanna probably never married.  The <br />\nname Joanna probably comes from Zechariah's (probable) mother, Joanna <br />\nGarrett (see below).  These figures reconcile nicely if Joanna's birth <br />\nyear is 1793, when Zechariah was 19 years of age.  Johannah is a common <br />\nname in the Davenport and allied families going back into the 1600s in <br />\nTyrrell County.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Joanna Davenport was Zechariah's child, she did not live in his <br />\nhousehold.  Possibly, she was raised by one of his siblings or by <br />\nPrecilla Sprouill's family.  Remember that Zachariah may have continued <br />\nto own property in Tyrrell County, in absentia, which could be the means <br />\nof supporting the child Joanna.  In the Tyrrell County census of 1820, a <br />\nJoanna Davenport appears as head of household for the first time, with <br />\nage 26-46 (she would have been just over 26) and does not appear <br />\nthereafter.  If the hypothesis is correct, she moved to Kentucky to be <br />\nnear her father, and died there in 1843.\n</p>\n<p>\nZechariah's parents, as stated on his death record, were Jacob and <br />\nElizabeth Davenport.  A Jacob Davenport of about the right age married <br />\n(1) Joanna Garrett on February 1, 1768 in Tyrrell County (North Carolina <br />\nmarriage records).  If this is Zechariah's father, then his mother's name <br />\nwas Joanna.  Jacob married (2) Elizabeth Duncan on February 17, 1779 in <br />\nTyrrell County (North Carolina marriage records).  There is no proof that <br />\nthese two marriage records refer to the same Jacob Davenport, but the <br />\nfact that Zechariah named his (probable) first child Joanna, yet his <br />\ndeath record lists his parents as Jacob and Elizabeth Davenport, is very <br />\nsuggestive.  Zechariah would have been raised from age 5 by Elizabeth, <br />\nand probably could scarcely remember Joanna.  Perhaps Jacob's first wife <br />\ndied, which was not uncommon.  Moreover, Zechariah named two of his <br />\nchildren Jacob and Elizabeth.  Confounding this hypothesis is the fact <br />\nthat there were at least three Jacob Davenports in Tyrrell County in the <br />\nlate 1700s. In a court action of 17 Sep 1765, John Davenport was stated <br />\nto have a son Jacob.  In Richard Davenport's will of 22 Nov 1773, he was <br />\nstated to have a son Jacob.  One of these is \"our\" Jacob.  In the Tyrrell <br />\nCounty tax list of 1784, there was a Jacob Davenport, Sr. and a Jacob <br />\nDavenport, Jr. in separate households.   The two Jacob Davenport <br />\nmarriages could merely refer to any of the three Jacobs.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Zechariah is buried at Wolf Creek, one explanation for why he does not <br />\nhave a headstone is community division over the issues that would <br />\neventually erupt as the Civil War.  Some of Zechariah's sons and nephews <br />\nspent some time in Arkansas in the 1840s and 1850s, because they had <br />\nchildren that are listed as born in Arkansas.  Kentucky was bitterly <br />\ndivided, and moving to Arkansas-Missouri territory was one way to escape <br />\nthe conflict and be on the Union side. Moreover, it is known that many <br />\nheadstones in cemeteries all over the South were removed or defaced <br />\nbecause of their owner's political views.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mormon FamilySearch International Genealogical Record (IGI) Film <br />\nNumber 903571 claims that Jacob was born \"ABT 1737\" and his father was <br />\nRichard.   The same record claims that Zachariah was born June 6, 1774, <br />\nwith parents Jacob Davenport and Johannah Garrett.  FamilySearch <br />\nAncestral File record AFN 11BW-B20 claims that William Davenport was born <br />\n\"ABT 1799\" in Whitley Co., KY, with parents Zachariah Davenport [AFN <br />\n11BW-B0K] and Precilla Spruill [AFN 11BW-B1R].  However, William was <br />\nactually born on May 31, 1800 (from his headstone] in Kentucky [from the <br />\ncensus], and Zechariah had already married Jane Douglass by that time <br />\n[from the Washington County, VA marriage records].\n</p>\n<p>\nIn roughly the same time frame as the above Zachariah, there was a <br />\nZachariah Davenport in the Pendleton District in South Carolina, who <br />\nmoved to Missouri.  There is no overlap or confusion in their respective <br />\nrecords.  He is probably related to James, Francis, and Joseph Davenport <br />\nwho were Revolutionary War soldiers from South Carolina.  This Zachariah <br />\nmarried Eliza Wittenberg on March 17, 1831 in Cape Girardeau County, <br />\nMissouri, and also received a land grant there in 1845.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
