{"name":"Gramps Dynamic Web Report","tagline":"Add-on for GRAMPS: Produces dynamic (based on Javascript) Web Pages for your family tree","body":"# GRAMPS Dynamic Web Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis add-on for GRAMPS is an alternative to the Narrative Web Report.\r\nIt exports the database as web pages.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nCompared to the Narrative Web Report, the Dynamic Web Report has the following differences:\r\n- The web pages could include a **browsable** family tree.  \r\n  This graphical family tree is printed using the SVG format.  \r\n  It could be zoomed (like google map) in order to print 30 generations or more (depends on your hardware).  \r\n  It show descendants or ancestry (or both), as a tree or as concentric circles.  \r\n- The web pages include a **search form**, in order to search for an individual.\r\n- The web pages include index pages that could be sorted by any column.\r\n- The pictures are clickable  \r\n  (the clickable regions correspond to the GRAMPS database media references regions)\r\n- The web pages generated are based on **client-side Javascript**.  \r\n  Hence, the generated site is smaller, and contains much less files.  \r\n  The web pages could be browsed in a regular web site or on the local machine.\r\n\r\n## Demos\r\n[Example using the default style](test_000/indi.html?FsearchTxt=Garner%20von%20Zieli%u0144ski%2C%20Lewis%20Anderson%20Sr)  \r\n[Example of graphical family tree](test_000/tree_svg.html?FsearchTxt=Garner%20von%20Zieli%u0144ski%2C%20Lewis%20Anderson%20Sr&idx=784&FsearchAsc=9&FsearchDsc=9&FsearchSvgType=12)  \r\n[Example using another style ('Mayence' style of the narrative web report)](test_001/indi.html?FsearchTxt=Garner%20von%20Zieli%u0144ski%2C%20Lewis%20Anderson%20Sr)  \r\n[Example of clickable picture](test_001/media.html?mdx=1)  \r\n[Example with minimal features (without private data, notes, sources, addresses, gallery, places, families, events)](test_004/indi.html?FsearchTxt=Garner%20von%20Zieli%u0144ski%2C%20Lewis%20Anderson%20Sr)\r\n\r\n## Development status\r\nThis report is only a **prototype** for evalutation.  \r\nThe to do list first item is: *Build a to do list*.  \r\nThe *dynamic way* (javascript) could be cool for implementing nice features.  \r\nThe code is not ready for coming out (not commented, poorly architectured, etc.)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
